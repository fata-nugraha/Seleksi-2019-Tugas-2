## DBMS Description

I chose MongoDB for the data storing, with the help of another application called MongoDB Compass, which acts as a GUI to represent the data to be easily comprehensible.

The main reason that I chose this DBMS, is due to its unique data structure that allows for the storing of composite objects within other composite objects while lacking consistency constraints for the collections' schemas. This allows for more versatile usage in contrast to relational DBMSs.

Were I to choose a relational MongoDB, there would be two main approaches that can be used for this project. The first option is to put the whole data in one big table, which would cause a massive redundancy, while the second option involves putting the data into separate tables, which would require the usage of join operations to execute some queries. Since both options seem unappealing to me, I decided to adopt a non-relational DBMS like MongoDB for this project.

One of the distinct advantages of using MongoDB lies in its capability in processing the JSON format. However, a certain difficulty also occurred because it is only later be known that the DBMS only accepts a certain JSON formatting, which demands that each entry must be written in a single line of JSON in the document. Said problem incurred the necessity to re-format my pre-procured JSON file.
